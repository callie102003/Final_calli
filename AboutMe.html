            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Bio/Skills/Achievements</h3>
            <p>Hello, I am originally from Makati City. 
                I was born on May 23, 2003, and I currently reside in Tarlac. 
                Growing up in this dynamic neighborhood shaped my values and goals.
                As an avid reader, I enjoy delving into literature about business and programming.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am now exploring the exciting world of BSIT as I embark on my path through higher education. 
                During my Second Year in college, I improved my programming skills by learning languages such as Python, Java, and HTML. 
                This learning experience has sparked my interest in technology, and I'm excited to put my knowledge and talents to use in real-world scenarios. 
                I am excited about the future and the prospects it contains, and I am devoted to continuing growth and constructive contributions to the field of information technology.</p>
